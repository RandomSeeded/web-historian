server basics

1. a get request to ('/') should return index.html
2. a get request to ('/somewebsitenamethathasbeenarchived') should return the archived page
3. a get request to ('/somerandomtextthatisntaserver') should return a 404 error
4. a post request to ('/') should add the url to sites.txt for later archiving

archive helpers

5. readListOfUrls should read sites.txt and return an array of sites to archive
6. isUrlInList should run its callback with the appropriate string as the param or undefined if it doesn't exist
7. addUrlToList should add the specified url to sites.txt and takes a callback (run with no params?)
8. isUrlArchived should run its callback with the specified url if it has already been archived or undefined
9. downloadUrls should save the websites in the current list and add the urls to archive.paths.archivedSites which should be an array.
